```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}

# This R Markdown file will generate a consent form in PDF format, using the
# name, date, and attached signature.

# This example uses a public form on ActivityInfo.org so you should be able
# to 'knit' this file directly to see the output.

# You can render this document from another R script (or a Shiny app for example)
# by running:
# rmarkdown::render(input = "consent.Rmd", parameters = list(record_id = "cxyz"))


library(activityinfo)

# Define the form and field ids. This needs to be updated
# to match the field ids in your own form!
formId <- "cepck8hl2ysuzs73"
nameFieldId <- "c3g1axl2ysvhcg6"
dateFieldId <- "c99kiydl2ysv9f34"
attachmentFieldId <- "c6ji06zl2ysvd6g5"

# Retrieve the individual record.
record <- getRecord(formId, params$record_id)

# Download the signature, which is stored as a signature
attachments <- record$fields[[attachmentFieldId]]
stopifnot(length(attachments) > 0)
signatureFile <- getAttachment(formId,
                           params$record_id,
                           attachmentFieldId,
                           attachments[[1]]$blobId)

# Copy the temp file to a file in the working directory. Temporary files
# are cleaned up after the R process exits and before converting the pdf

file.copy(signatureFile, "signature.png")
